a working sample truffle project 
This is basically the default truffle "MetaCoin" contract, i.e. a placeholder for a real token contract.
You may need to delete the build directory and rebuild. 
Make sure web3.js is in the build folder! Otherwise you need to be using Mist Browser or MetaMask.
This configuration assumes a development environment rather than production...
